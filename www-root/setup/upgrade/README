ENTRADA UPGRADE README

Unfortunately there is no automated upgrade utility for Entrada at this point,
although that will change in a future release.

In the mean time upgrading is not very difficult simply replace all Entrada
files and then execute the SQL queries within this directory sequentially from
your old version to your new version. For example if you are currently running
Entrada 1.0.0 and you wish to upgrade to Entrada 1.2.0 then execute each SQL
file in the 1100 and 1200 directories.
